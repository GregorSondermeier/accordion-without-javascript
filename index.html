                I know words. I have the best words. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these
                words it's unbelievable. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack
                Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these
                words it's unbelievable.

                I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It
                could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be
                some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? It’s about making placeholder text
                great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again.

                My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. We are going to make
                placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before.

                I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.
                Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You
                either have it or you don't.

                Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most
                popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that
                comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

                Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you
                know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most
                times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because
                of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

                Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while
                I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
                case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this
                case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
